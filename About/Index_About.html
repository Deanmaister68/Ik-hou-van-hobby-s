<div id="infobox2"><h3>origin</h3>--------------------------------------------------------------------i love hobbies was created in 1999. When the creators named Jeff and Alex kuipers went tot he bar they started talking and got to a point where they wanted to do lots of things but it was way to expensive to do on your own. That's when they got the idea for I love hobbies, they were going to make a company so they could organize hobbies and then make people pay less for them. that way people could also do more expensive hobbies once or twice without paying too much.</div>
